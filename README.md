# Office Lunch Platform - Frontend

A React.js project, with create-react-app

## Development setup
___

First, download dependencies.

```
npm install
```
Then, you need to configure your own **REACT_APP_API_URL** in **.env.development** file, that is located in the root directory. But for that, you need your local Backend server.

So, if you don't know how to setup the Backend, read this repository: [https://github.com/FernandoDzay/express-office-lunch]('https://github.com/FernandoDzay/express-office-lunch', 'Backend repository'). Or if you want, you can point to my testing online server.
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://express-office-lunch.luisdzay.com
```

Finally, just execute:
```
npm start
```
And the project is going to be open in your default browser.

Setup your own online Backend server, and then configure **.env.production** file.
